ex: emp table has 4 buckets.

hive>select * from emp TABLESAMPLE(BUCKET 1 OUT OF 4);

n/y :-
------
4/4 = 1 group which contains (1,2,3,4)' so it will pick 1st bucket out of group of 4.
TABLESAMPLE(BUCKET 2 OUT OF 8)
4/8 = ½ (half group, 1,2,3,4….8 we have only 4 buckets, so 5,6,7,8 are not buckets) so it will 
pick 2nd bucket

here n is no.of buckets.

How Sampling Works:
-------------------
When you create the table and bucket it using the clustered by clause into 32 buckets
(as an example), hive buckets your data into 32 buckets using deterministic hash functions. 
Then when you use TABLESAMPLE(BUCKET x OUT OF y), hive divides your buckets into groups of 
y buckets and then picks the xth bucket of each group. 
For example:

1) if you use TABLESAMPLE(BUCKET 6 OUT OF 8), hive would divide your 32 buckets into groups of 8 
   buckets resulting in 4 groups of 8 buckets and then picks the 6th bucket of each group, hence 
    picking the buckets 6, 14, 22, 30. 
2) if TABLESAMPLE(BUCKET 23 OUT OF 32), hive would divide your 32 buckets 
   into groups of 32, resulting in only 1 group of 32 buckets, and then picks the 23rd bucket as 
   your result. 
3) if you use TABLESAMPLE(BUCKET 3 OUT OF 64), hive would divide your 32 buckets into groups of 
   64 buckets, resulting in 1 group of 64 “half-bucket”s and then picks the half-bucket that 
   corresponds to the 3rd full-bucket.


Note: Set the no of reducers = no of buckets
set map.reduce.tasks = 25
set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;

NOTE: In partitioned tables when we issue a query only the required partitions are scanned, 
no need to specify any hints in your hive query. But for bucketed tables it is not the case, 
you need to hint your hive query if you want to scan some particular buckets else the whole set 
of files would be scanned. We hint the buckets using TABLESAMPLE clause in our hive query. 

For example in our example if we want to choose only the data from BUCKET 2

hive> SELECT * FROM sample_buckets1 TABLESAMPLE(BUCKET 2 OUT OF 5 ON key);
