bucketing:
----------
bucketing is, which divides the table data into multiple data files.

each bucket is a data file.

advantage: sampling the tables data.
----------
In hive bucketing will do sampling without replacement(i.e we don't 
find common data in other bucket files, every bucket file has unique data)

In pig, sampling is with replacement(i.e we may get common data in 
other datasets)

ex: we are bucketing on p_id column(produt_id)

p1,p2,p3,p1,p2,p3,p4 are p_id's

we are performing 2 buckets on table:

bucket1,bucket2

bucket1--->p1,p3,p1,p3
bucket2--->p2,p2,p4

2 buckets as b1,b2:

p1--->100%2---->b1
p2--->101%2---->b2
p3--->102%2---->b1
p4--->103%2---->b2

NOTE: A single bucket can have multiple keys, but a key is available with only one bucket


By default bucketing feature was disabled, we need to enable by below query:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
hive> set hive.enforce.bucketing;(to see current status,if it is false change     to true)
hive.enforce.bucketing=false
hive> set hive.enforce.bucketing=true;


NOTE: TO RETRIVE THE DATA FROM “BUCKETED” TABLE USE “TABLESAMPLE” CLAUSE
ex:
hive> SELECT * FROM buckettab TABLESAMPLE(bucket 2 out of 4);
hive> SELECT * FROM buckettab TABLESAMPLE(bucket 3 out of 4);
hive> SELECT * FROM buckettab TABLESAMPLE(bucket 1 out of 2);
